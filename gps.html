					<p><u>Excerpts from observation #2: Jaime G.</u></p>
					<p>“Jaime pulled over on a stop sign on Ben White and Hudson and typed in the address of a nearby apartment complex to at least be able to get to that area. Once he had mapped where he was going, he tucked his phone under his leg and didn’t look at it for a while. The voice option on Google Maps was turned off as well.”</p>
					<p>“Coming off the highway, Jaime had to get into the right lane right away (three lanes away). His body tensed up as he looked to his right blind spot to make sure he was clear. There were lots of cars, so he slowly made his way over. He missed the turn for South Lamar (the turn is tricky and confusing because it’s a type of turn that’s angled in a way) and ended up having to turn at the light. At first he asked us if it was okay for him to turn on that street, but neither Daowz nor I knew the answer.”</p>
					<p>“At the next stop light, he checked his phone for the first time since he started driving. He turned on the voice option on Google Maps which then started saying things like “In 500 feet, turn left on…” “In a quarter mile…”. It was difficult for Jaime to gauge his distance and since he had never been to Accent Auto before, he relied on me to get him there. I knew the area better and pointed the mental landmarks I knew and told him where to turn.”</p>

					<p><u>Excerpts from observation #3: Daowz S</u></p>
					<p>“As soon as Daowz got into the driver's seat, she attempted to turn the car on. After this, she adjusted her seat as best as she could but she could not figure out how to scoot her seat to move closer to the steering wheel until I helped her find the lever under her seat. After this, she tried to move the car until we figured out she had not fully put the car key in. When we had finally figured out that the key had not been fully turned on, she told me 'I'm nervous about driving other people's cars…'"</p>
					<p>”We were already on the street when she decided to look up the Infiniti dealership that we were headed to. At a stop sign, she typed it in onto Google Maps (just like Jaime had done so previously.) After she had looked up the address, she placed her phone in the cupholder (just like Alex had done so previously). Daowz however, chose to look at her phone’s map screen by picking her phone up and placing it near her line of sight instead of looking down at it in her cupholder. Daowz prefers to keep her eyes on the road whilst looking at her phone.”</p>
					<p>“Google Maps voice option is on at all times.”</p>
					<p>“I noticed she chose to take a longer road instead of a shorter one because it was safer. (The shorter road would've included U-turns and dangerous turns that would've also included turning into a middle lane in order to turn in the right direction.)”</p>
					<p>“After we were on the highway for quite some time, we needed to get off. She was confused as to when to when to get off the highway and said "wait...so do I…?" and then she grabbed her phone to look. At times, she needed some encouragement as to when to take a turn or go ahead and go.” </p>

					<p>Viewpoint
					<br>Driving can become an intimidating task to a lot of people; navigating somewhere (especially
					unknown areas) should be straightforward. By stripping down unnecessary information and using
					more humanistic language on GPS navigation systems on smartphones, users can avoid confusion
					when navigating from point A to point B. Hand drawn maps contain only essential information,
					simple terms and landmarks- this is where I drew my main inspiration from.<br></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Do users understand the navigational architecture of the app? Can they auickly find their way
						around? Are any of the buttons or inputs confusing?</li>
						<li>Is the language I used consistent and easy to understand? (ex. “Map Style”, “Navigate By”</li>
						<li>Would this app simplify the navigation from point A to point B enough to where it is no longer
						confusing?</li>
						<li>What other features would encourage people to use this app more?</li>
						<li>What would stop people from using the app?</li>
						<li>Would this app be simple and safe enough to use while driving?</li>

					<p>Participants
					<br>My three participants will be friends/colleagues who have cars that tend to use their smartphone as

					<p>Informed Consent
					<br>I provided every user an informed consent sheet and had them sign and return it to me stating that their results will be used to improve upon my design.<br></p>	
					<p>Plan
					<br>Time Period: Usability tests will be performed between August 15-August 24th. I will use 3 different time periods of the day for each participant. Participants will be randomly selected, one will perform the test at 10 am, one at 3 pm, and one at 7 pm.
					<br>Test length: Each test will last around 10 minutes.
					<br>Location: The users will all perform the usability tests while driving their car. I will ask the driver to perform the taasks as they usually would whilst driving/navigating somewhere. I will pick a nearby neighborhood that is relatively free of traffic to make this as safe and realistic and possible.<br></p>

					to just have an option where it’s just essentially a GPS but drawn out. The point of hand drawn
					maps is the landmarks aspect of it, which is already an option.”

					so much better than regular streets, so I think this is a good option in terms of like, how people think.”
					<br>“You should also do like an option of the GPS telling you to “turn after this street” so you’re not trying to
